# Task Tracker CLI

A simple command-line interface (CLI) application to manage and track your tasks efficiently.

---

## Project Overview

This project is designed to help you build a CLI tool for task management, focusing on essential operations like adding, updating, deleting, and listing tasks. Tasks are stored in a local `tasks.json` file, ensuring data persistence across sessions. This application is ideal for developers looking to practice file handling, user input processing, and building CLI applications.

Inspired by the [Task Tracker project on roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/projects/task-tracker), this tool serves as a practical exercise in creating a functional and user-friendly command-line application.

## üóÇÔ∏è Data Storage

Tasks are stored in a JSON file named `tasks.json` located in the same directory as the script. If the file doesn't exist, it will be created automatically.

Each task is represented as an object with the following structure:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "description": "Task description",
  "status": "todo",
  "createdAt": "2025-09-01T13:00:00Z",
  "updatedAt": "2025-09-01T13:00:00Z"
}
```
